Dataset is divided into 7 tables, one table for all orders that needs to be assigned a route â€“ OrderList table, and 6 additional files specifying the problem and restrictions. For instance, the FreightRates table describes all available couriers, the weight gaps for each individual lane and rates associated. The PlantPorts table describes the allowed links between the warehouses and shipping ports in real world. Furthermore, the ProductsPerPlant table lists all supported warehouse-product combinations. The VmiCustomers lists all special cases, where warehouse is only allowed to support specific customer, while any other non-listed warehouse can supply any customer. Moreover, the WhCapacities lists warehouse capacities measured in number of orders per day and the WhCosts specifies the cost associated in storing the products in given warehouse measured in dollars per unit.

Order ID is ID of the order made by the customer, product ID is the specific product ID customer ordered.

"tpt_day_cnt" in the FrieghtRates table means transportation day count, i.e. estimated shipping time.

WhCapacities correspond to the number of orders. For example, let's say Customer 1 requests 10 units of X, Customer 2 requests 20 units of Y. The total number of orders is 2, thus total capacity in "whCapacity" is 2.

WhCapacities table is the maximum number of orders that can be processed per each plant, it is not dependant on specific products.
